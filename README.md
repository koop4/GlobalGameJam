#FAQ:

## What is a game jam?
"Jam" is a reference to musician jam sessions. The goal is to come together and make a videogame, or non-digital game like a board game or card game. Participants rapidly prototype game designs and hopefully inject new ideas to help grow the game industry. We share a common theme and constraints. We ask participants to create a game from beginning to end in a prescribed time (maximum of 48 hours). The brief time span is meant to help encourage creative thinking to result in small but innovative and experimental games.

## What is the Global Game Jam?
The GGJ brings the community together to work together for a weekend to make games. It is a unique opportunity for people to create, collaborate and practice their game making skills, and invites everyone of any skill level to take part.

Participants work concurrently around the globe; we rally around a central theme, and then have 48 hours to create a game. It's our hope that we will see some very experimental prototypes that you can continue to work on after the jam. Many games developed in previous Game Jams have become fully realized games. 

The GGJ is open source, hardware & software agnostic and all projects are released under a Creative Commons license. We encourage people to try out new ideas and push themselves, within reason. We also strongly encourage participants to remember to eat and sleep, to stay at their best!
